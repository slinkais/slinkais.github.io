                    <p>Pepe the Frog is an anthropomorphic frog character from the comic series Boy’s Club by Matt Furie. On 4chan, various illustrations of the frog creature have been used as reaction faces, including Feels Good Man, Sad Frog, Angry Pepe,
                        Smug Frog and Well Meme’d.</p>
                    <h3>Origin</h3>
                    <p>In 2005, artist Matt Furie created the comic series Boy’s Club, which stars the teenage monster characters Pepe, Brett, Andy and Landwolf.</p>
                    <p>In early 2008, a comic in which Pepe pulls his pants down to his ankles in order to urinate was popularized on 4chan’s /b/, (random) board, along with the expression “Feels good man.”</p>
                    <h3>Spread</h3>
                    <p>Throughout 2008, Pepe was mostly associated with the “Feels Good Man” reaction image. In 2009, an edited version featuring a distraught-looking Pepe with the caption “Feels bad man” began circulating as a reaction image on 4chan and
                        the Body Building Forums. On January 25th, 2011, an interview with Furie was published on Know Your Meme, in which he discussed the origins of Pepe the Frog. On June 13th, 2014, the PepeTheFrogBlog Tumblr[11] blog was launched.
                        On July 23rd, the Pepe the Frog Instagram[14] feed was created. On October 25th, the /r/pepethefrog[13] subreddit was launched for content featuring the frog character. On December 7th, a Facebook[10] page for “Pepe the Frog” was
                        created. On December 18th, the PepeTheFrogNet Tumblr[12] blog was launched.</p>
